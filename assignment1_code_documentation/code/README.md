# Assignment 1 - Code documentation

**GOAL**: Train then evaluate a basic NER system, documenting the code, model and experiment.

**TODO**: 
* Find out what the code in `basic_system.ipynb` does
* Run the code and provide evaluation results
* Fill in all the **TODO**s in this README and in the `basic_system.ipynb` notebook. Feel free to keep or remove the **Hint**s and **Note**s. 

## Introduction
**TODO**: Briefly describe the model provided in `basic_system.ipynb` and the experiment you apply it for.

**Hint**: You may want to have a look at [the scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html).

## Prerequisites

**TODO**: fill in `requirements.txt` and explain how to set up the environment to run `basic_system.ipynb`.

**Hint**: Install the latest library versions and run `pip list` afterwards to check the version numbers; you can use these versions for `requirements.txt`.

**Note**: For this assignment, you will have a single `requirements.txt` file. For future assignments, we will provide a `requirements.txt` file under the assignment folder, and you should only add a `requirements.txt` file under the `code/` folder if you need additional libraries. 

## Running the code

**TODO**: Explain how to run the code 

## Evaluation

**TODO**: Provide evaluation results
